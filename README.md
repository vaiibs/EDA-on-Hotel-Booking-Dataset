This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to identify trends, patterns, and insights. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries, we explore customer booking behaviors, cancellation trends, and factors influencing hotel demand.

Research Question
 1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
 2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
 3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?
